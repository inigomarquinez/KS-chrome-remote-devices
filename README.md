**Category**: Knowledge Sharing

## What is Remote Debugging?

[Remote Debugging](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/) lets you inspect a page running on an Android device from your development machine.

## How to run it

![Open 'Remote Devices' tab](./resources/how-to-open-remote-devices.png?raw=true)

## When to use it

- If we need to check the behaviour of the app in the **real device** and at the same time be able to debug a feature.
- If we need to check a different behaviour when the user uses the application in a computer browser or in a portable device browser.
- Easy and fast **alternative** to Android Studio for debugging.
- Even if we need to show a **screencast** of the application in a real device instead of a simulator.

## Limitations

Only for **Android devices**.
